
Release Notes for EEZ Match Student Edition V. 1.3.0.1
------------------------------------------------------

EEZ Match is now fully verified to run under Windows 3.1, Win95,
and WinOS2 (under the Warp operating system).  There are some
issues remaining with WinNT which are still being resolved.

Enhancements:
-------------

* The previous restriction of no more than 256 display colors is
  lifted with this release.

* Component markers that are on top of one another may be selected
  independently by clicking the left mouse button repeatedly.
  The selected component will appear in the annotation windows 
  which display the value of the network and the component.
  (There may be a problem if the component is deleted later -- see 
  below.)

* Component buttons now display correctly under Windows NT, but
  not in all cases.  There appears to be some factors regarding
  the display driver that might be affecting the "user drawn"
  buttons used in EEZ Match.  This is the issue still remaining
  with WinNT, mentioned above.

Known Bugs:
-----------

* The user may get a "Runtime Error" notification when deleting
  a component.  When this occurs, there may be more than one
  component actually deleted.  Otherwise, the error is harmless.
  This error is related to having component markers on top of
  one another.

* Resistors and transmission lines can't accept negative values.
  (This is more of a feature enhancement than a bug, as EEZ Match
  is behaving as originally designed.  It is still being addressed.)
